* Allowed States
These are the allowed states that can be captured and need to be checked for

** Arrival of New Customer ( with request in the system)
Each arrival request can be considered an _independant_ event.  
Look into this more when it becomes more relevant
** Departure of Bus from location
** Arrival of Bus at Stop
** Disembarkation of a passenger ( constant time to unload each passenger? )
** Boarding of a passenger


* The Network
The network is being implemented as a Single, Directed Graph.
It is described as the vertices being the bus stops,
with the edges being the travel time (in minutes) between those edges.

** Thoughts about implementation
Worth having a look into Dijkstra's Algorithm for this problem.
(Is there a max runtime for this project? or can optimisation occur?)
- If time, possibly look into multi-threading for path-finding...
